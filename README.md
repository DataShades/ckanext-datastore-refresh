# ckanext-datastore-refresh

:arrows_clockwise: :clock9:

This extension provides a option to refresh/reupload the datastore data when resource is uploaded by URL. Because there is no mechanism within CKAN core to track the changes in the files after the upload, we need to create cronjob that would call the CLI command to refresh data defined by the configuration panel as CKAN sysadmin.


## Requirements

Works with CKAN 2.9.x and above(python v3.7 and above).

Depends on [ckanext-xloader](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-xloader)

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version | Compatible? |
|--------------|-------------|
| 2.9          | yes         |
| 2.10         | yes         |


## Installation

To install ckanext-datastore-refresh:

1. Clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/ckanext-datastore-refresh.git
    cd ckanext-datastore-refresh
    pip install -e .
    ```
1. Add `datastore_refresh` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file.

1. Apply DB migrations:
   ```sh
   ckan db upgrade -p datastore_refresh
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is done by the CKAN admin menu

```
@hourly datastore_config -c /path/to/ckan.ini refresh_dataset_datastore 10
```
10 - frequency  to refresh the datastore  (in minutes)
Cron jobs can be set by the desired frequency which currently is set to 10 min, 2 hours or 24 hours

#TODO: Make frequencies configurable via ckan.ini file

## Tests

To run the tests, do:
```sh
pytest
```
